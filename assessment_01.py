# A coffee shop needs to keep track the orders for delivery they receive by phone calls.
# The coffee shop has several employees that will be using the system:
# 1. Clerks: Set orders and can check if there are pending orders.
# 2. Delivery: Update an order as completed.
# 3. Manager: View reports and statistics.
# Each employee will have a user account to login (username/password) and the system will
# identify their role and respond accordingly

#After each order placed, the clerk will enter to the system:
# 1. The name of the customer
# 2. Address of the customer
# 3. Description
# 4. Date (formatted as: DDMMYY)
# 5. Total amount of order

# An ID, auto-increment number, will be assigned by the system to the order.
# The clerk will be able to bulk upload orders using preformatted files (txt or csv).
# The clerk will also be able to check incomplete orders.

# Upon delivery, the delivery employee will get into the system and update the order as completed.

# The manager will be able to select from the system to do the following:
# 1. Numbers of order placed by one specific customer
# 2. Number of orders in one specific day
# 3. Total amount of all orders delivered
# 4. Total amount of the orders placed by a specific customer
# 5. Total amount of the orders placed on specific day

#Also, the manager will be able to select from the system to receive the following reports: (in .csv format)
# 1. Names of customers
# 2. Orders entered per user
# 3. All data entered
# 4. Total amount of orders per day (one record per day)
